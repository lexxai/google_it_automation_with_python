# Practice Quiz:  Updating Deployments

*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%*

### Question 1

1. What is a production environment in Puppet?

> - [ ] The software used for software development such as IDEs.
> - [x] **The parts of the infrastructure where a service is executed, and served to its users.**
> - [ ] A cloud service for commercial production.
> - [ ] A Virtual Machine reserved for beta software.

*Environments in Puppet are used to isolate software in development from software being served to end users.*

### Question 2

2. What is the --noop parameter used for?

> - [ ] Passing a variable called noop to Puppet
> - [ ] Adding conditional rules to manifests
> - [ ] Defining what operations not to perform in a manifest
> - [x] **Simulating manifest evaluation without taking any actions**

*No Operations mode makes Puppet simulate what it would do without actually doing it.*

### Question 3

3. What do rspec tests do?

> - [ ] Checks that nodes can connect to the puppet master correctly
> - [ ] Check the specification of the current node
> - [x] **Check the manifests for specific content**
> - [ ] Checks that the node is running the correct operating system

*We can test our manifests automatically by using rspec tests. In these tests, we can verify resources exist*\
*and have attributes set to specific values*

### Question 4

4. How are canary environments used in testing?

> - [ ] To store unused code
> - [x] **As a test environment to detect problems before they reach the production environment**
> - [ ] As a repository for alternative coding methods for a particular problem
> - [ ] As a test environment for final software versions*

*If we can identify a problem before it reaches all the machines in the production environment,*\
*weâ€™ll be able to keep the problem isolated.*

### Question 5

5. What are efficient ways to check the syntax of the manifest? (Check all that apply)

> - [x] **Run full No Operations simulations**
> - [x] **Run rspec tests**
> - [ ] Test manually
> - [x] **puppet parser validate**n

*In order to perform No Operations simulations, we must use the --noop parameter when running the rules.*\
*To test automatically, we need to run rspec tests, and fix any errors in the manifest until the RSpec tests pass.*\
*Using the puppet parser validate command is the simplest way to check that the syntax of the manifest is correct.*
