# Loops

In this module you'll explore the intricacies of loops in Python! You'll learn how to use while loops to continuously\
execute code, as well as how to identify infinite loop errors and how to fix them. You'll also learn to use for loops\
to iterate over data, and how to use the range() function with for loops. You'll also explore common errors when using\
for loops and how to fix them.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement while loops to continuously execute code while a condition is true
- Identify and fix infinite loops when using while loops
- Utilize for loops to iterate over a block of code
- Use the range() function to control for loops
- Use nested while and for loops with if statements
- Identify and correct common errors when using loops.
