*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%*

### Question 1

1. This code is supposed to display "2 + 2 = 4" on the screen, but there is an error.\
 Find the error in the code and fix it, so that the output is correct.

```Python
print("2 + 2 = " + str((2 + 2)))
```

*Way to go! You noticed the missing conversion into string, and fixed it!*

### Question 2

2. In this scenario, two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars.\
The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% tip for the service.\
Calculate the tip, the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying\
"Each person needs to pay: " followed by the resulting number.

```Python
bill = 47.28 # Assign "bill" variable with bill amount
tip = bill * 0.15 # Multiply by stated tip rate 
total = bill + tip # Sum the "total" of the "bill" and "tip"
share = total / 2 # Divide "total" by number of friends dining
print( "Each person needs to pay: " + str(share)) # Enter the required string and "share" 
# Hint: Remember to convert incompatible data types
```

*Great work! Youâ€™ve given the computer correct instructions at each step, paying attention to every detail, and it paid off!*

### Question 3

3. This code is supposed to take two numbers, divide one by another so that the result is equal to 1,\
and display the result on the screen. Unfortunately, there is an error in the code.\
Find the error and fix it, so that the output is correct.

```Python
numerator = 10
denominator = 10
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)
```

*You got it!. You caught the error and fixed it! Way to go!*

### Question 4

4. Combine the variables to display the sentence "How do you like Python so far?"

```Python
word1 = "How"
word2 = "do"
word3 = "you"
word4 = "like"
word5 = "Python"
word6 = "so"
word7 = "far?"

print(word1 + " " + word2 + " " + word3 + " " + word4 + " " + word5 + " " + word6 + " " + word7)
```

*Nice job! You caught the error and fixed it! Way to go!*

### Question 5

5. What do you call a combination of numbers, symbols, or other values that produce a result when evaluated?

> - [ ] An explicit conversion
> - [x] **An expression**
> - [ ] A variable
> - [ ] An implicit conversion

*Right on! An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.*
