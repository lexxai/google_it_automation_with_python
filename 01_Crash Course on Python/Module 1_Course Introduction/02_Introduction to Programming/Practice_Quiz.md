# Practice Quiz: Introduction to Programming

*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%*

### Question 1

1. What’s a computer program?

> - [ ] A set of languages available in the computer
> - [ ] A process for getting duplicate values removed from a list
> - [x] **A list of instructions that the computer has to follow to reach a goal**
> - [ ] A file that gets copied to all machines in the netwo

*You nailed it! At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do.*

### Question 2

2. What’s the syntax of a language?

> - [x] **The rules of how to express things in that language**
> - [ ] The subject of a sentence
> - [ ] The difference between one language and another
> - [ ] The meaning of the words

*Right on! In a human language, syntax is the rules for how a sentence is constructed, and in a programming language,*\
*syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written.

### Question 3

3. What’s the difference between a program and a script?

> - [x] **There’s not much difference, but scripts are usually simpler and shorter.**
> - [ ] Scripts are only written in Python.
> - [ ] Scripts can only be used for simple task
> - [ ] Programs are written by software engineers; scripts are written by system administrators.

*You got it! The line between a program and a script is blurry; scripts usually have a shorter development cycle.*\
*This means that scripts are shorter, simpler, and can be written very quickly.*

### Question 4

4. Which of these scenarios are good candidates for automation? Select all that apply.

> - [x] **Generating a sales report, split by region and product type**
> - [ ] Creating your own startup company
> - [ ] Helping a user who’s having network troubles
> - [x] Copying a file to all computers in a company

*Creating a report that presents stored data in specific ways is a tedious task that can be easily automated.*\
*A task like copying files to other computers is easily automated, and helps to reduce unnecessary manual work.*

### Question 5

5. What are semantics when applied to programming code?

> - [ ] The rules for how a programming instruction is written
> - [ ] The difference in number values in one instance of a script compared to another
> - [x] **The intended meaning or logic of coded statements**
> - [ ] The end result of a programming instruction

*Nice job! The intended meaning or effect of coded statements are referred to as semantics.*
