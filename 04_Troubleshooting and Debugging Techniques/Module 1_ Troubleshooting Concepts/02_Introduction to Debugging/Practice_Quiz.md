*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%*

### Question 1

1. What is part of the final step when problem solving?

> - [ ] Documentation
> - [x] **Long-term remediation**
> - [ ] Finding the root cause
> - [ ] Gathering information

*Nice job! Long-term remediation is part of the final step when problem solving.*

### Question 2

2. Which tool can you use when debugging to look at library calls made by the software?

> - [ ] top
> - [ ] strace
> - [ ] tcpdump
> - [x] **ltrace**

*Way to go! git rebase is useful for maintaining a clean, linear commit history.*

### Question 3

3. What is the first step of problem solving?

> - [ ] Prevention
> - [x] **Gathering information**
> - [ ] Long-term remediation
> - [ ] Finding the root cause

*Right on! Gathering information is the first step taken when problem solving.*

### Question 4

4. What software tools are used to analyze network traffic to isolate problems? (Check all that apply)

> - [x] **tcpdump**
> - [x] **wireshark**
> - [ ] strace
> - [ ] top

*Nice work! The tcpdump tool is a powerful command-line analyzer that captures or "sniffs" TCP/IP packets.*\
*Excellent! Wireshark is an open source tool for profiling network traffic and analyzing TCP/IP packets.*

### Question 5

5. The strace (in Linux) tool allows us to see all of the _____ our program has made.

> - [ ] Network traffic
> - [ ] Disk writes
> - [x] **System calls**
> - [ ] Connection requests

*Awesome! The strace command shows us all the system calls our program made.*\
*System calls are the calls that the programs running in our computer make to the running kernel.*
