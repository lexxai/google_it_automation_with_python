# Practice Quiz:  When Slowness Problems Get Complex

*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%*

### Question 1

1. Which of the following can cache database queries in memory for faster processing of automated tasks?

> - [ ] Threading
> - [ ] Varnish
> - [x] **Memcached**
> - [ ] SQLite

*Awesome! Using a dictionary is faster to look up elements than going through a list.*

### Question 2

2. What module specifies parts of a code to run in separate asynchronous events?

> - [ ] Threading
> - [ ] Futures
> - [ ] **Asyncio**
> - [ ] Concurrent

*Loops that run indefinitely, and include subtasks to complete before moving on can be very expensive for most automation tasks.*

### Question 3

3. Which of the following allows our program to run multiple instructions in parallel?

> - [x] **Threading**
> - [ ] Swap space
> - [ ] Memory addressing
> - [ ] Dual SSD

*Woohoo! Threading allows a process to split itself into parallel tasks.*

### Question 4

4. What is the name of the field of study in computer science that concerns itself with\
 writing programs and operations that run in parallel efficiently?

> - [ ] Memory management
> - [x] **Concurrency**
> - [ ] Threading
> - [ ] Performance analysis

*Concurrency in computer science is the ability of different sections or units of a program, algorithm,*\
*or problem to be executed out of order or in partial order, without impacting the final result.*

### Question 5

5. What would we call a program that often leaves our CPU with little to do as it waits on data\
 from a local disk and the Internet?

> - [ ] Memory-bound
> - [ ] CPU-bound
> - [ ] User-bound
> - [ ] **I/O bound**

*Right on! If our program mainly finds itself waiting on local disks or the network, it is I/O bound.*
