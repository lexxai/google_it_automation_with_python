# Video Quiz: When Slowness Problems Get Complex

### Question 1

1. A script is _____ if you are running operations in parallel using all available CPU time.

> - [ ] I/O bound
> - [ ] Threading
> - [x] **CPU bound**
> - [ ] Asyncio

*Right on! A script is CPU bound if you're running operations in parallel using all available CPU time.*

### Question 2

2. Youâ€™re creating a simple script that runs a query on a list of product names of a very small business,\
and initiates automated tasks based on those queries. Which of the following would you use to store product names?

The web server is processing requests very slowly. Checking the web server, you found the disk I/O has high latency.\
Where is the cause of the slow website requests most likely originating from?  

> - [x] **Local disk**

*You got it! The local disk I/O latency is causing the application to wait too long for data from disk.*

### Question 4

4. Which module makes it possible to run operations in a script in parallel that makes better use of CPU processing time? 

> - [ ] Executor
