00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.600
During this course, you

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.565
started writing
some serious code.

3
00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.500
As you progress, you probably

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.570
realize that it would
be pretty helpful to

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.040
have a tool to keep copies of

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.905
your code as you add
or remove features.

7
00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:22.995
This is exactly what you'll
learn in the next course.

8
00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:24.555
To tell you more about that,

9
00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:25.815
here's my colleague, Kenny,

10
00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:27.255
who will be your instructor.

11
00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:28.830
Hey, Kenny, what can

12
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.555
learners expect from
the next course?

13
00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:32.190
Hey, whats up, Roger, and

14
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.035
hello to all the
learners out there.

15
00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:36.420
I'm super excited
about the next course.

16
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.640
We're going to learn
about version control,

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.990
which is the process of keeping

18
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.285
a history of how
your code changes.

19
00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:44.335
We'll focus on a tool called Git,

20
00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:45.860
which is the most popular version

21
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.555
control tool used today.

22
00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:49.400
We'll learn how to
use it not only for

23
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.200
our own projects but also as

24
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.970
a way to collaborate
with others through

25
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.235
a popular platform called GitHub.

26
00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:58.380
I can't wait to get to it.

27
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.190
This tool is super useful and

28
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.390
mastering it will make

29
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.400
a big difference
in your IT career.

30
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.320
A great thing about
the next course is

31
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.030
that we'll learn both
how to use it to keep

32
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.395
track of your personal code

33
00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:11.810
and how to use it to
collaborate with others.

34
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.580
I'm excited to share
this knowledge with

35
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.565
you and I'll see you over there.

36
00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:19.445
Cool. Thanks, Kenny, and
thank you everyone of you

37
00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.290
for tuning in and
hanging out with me in

38
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.240
this course. Bye for now.
