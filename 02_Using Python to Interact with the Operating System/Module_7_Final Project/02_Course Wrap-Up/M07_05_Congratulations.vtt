00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.450
Queue the graduation music,

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.055
you've made it to the
end of the course.

3
00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:13.695
Congrats, it's been
a long journey

4
00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.110
and you should feel really
excited for making it here.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.500
By now, you're much
more familiar with

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.760
the operating system and

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.080
the many different tasks that you

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.195
can accomplish using Python.

9
00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:24.830
You know how to create,

10
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.380
change, and delete
files and directories.

11
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.110
You know how to process text
with regular expressions

12
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.365
both with Python and
with system tools.

13
00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.880
You've learned how
to interact with

14
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.680
system processes by starting

15
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.525
them and sending signals to them.

16
00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:40.940
You've got some experience
with automatically testing

17
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.625
your code to make sure that
it does what it should.

18
00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.050
You've dipped your toes into

19
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.210
some Bash scripting and
you've topped all of this

20
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.799
off by solving a complex

21
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.200
real-world problem
with the coding road.

22
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.405
I hope that you had a
lot of fun getting here.

23
00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:55.190
The most fun and
rewarding part of

24
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.974
my job as a system administrator,

25
00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:58.400
is getting the code to work.

26
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.680
Sometimes the path to
accomplish what you

27
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.290
want isn't straightforward
and inevitably,

28
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.895
you're going to
make some mistakes.

29
00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:06.410
But there's nothing
like the moment of

30
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.440
clarity you get when you
spot the change that you

31
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.340
need to make so that
everything works

32
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.605
like magic, huge win.

33
00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.510
The first automation
script that I ever

34
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.700
wrote was for a
previous job I had.

35
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.470
We had a handful of servers,

36
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.655
and on a monthly basis,

37
00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:21.560
we would manually
archives some files,

38
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.620
check for updates and install
them if there were any.

39
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.585
It was a pretty repetitive task

40
00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.235
and not the best use of our time.

41
00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.815
After the second round of
going through this process,

42
00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:32.435
I wrote a script that automated

43
00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:34.610
all these steps in
the same order.

44
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.495
I also created a log file of
what the script was doing.

45
00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:42.320
It was so satisfying to execute
the code and see it work.

46
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.480
I hope you have lots of
opportunities to share

47
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480
that same feeling. All right.

48
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.050
I had a real blast spending this

49
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.820
time with you and
sharing a little bit of

50
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.050
my story and my passion for
IT and system administration.

51
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.410
It isn't easy to learn
some of these concepts,

52
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.235
so thank you for
sticking with it.

53
00:01:58.235 --> 00:02:00.710
On behalf of my colleagues
who you've met,

54
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.210
or who you'll meet
in other courses,

55
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.940
we'd like to say good
luck and we hope to see

56
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.110
you out there in the world

57
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.730
putting your new
skills into action.
