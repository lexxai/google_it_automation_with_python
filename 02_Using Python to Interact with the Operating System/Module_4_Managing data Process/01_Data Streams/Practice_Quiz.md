*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%*

### Question 1

1. Which commmand will print out the exit xalue of a script that just ran successfully?

> - [ ] echo $PATH
> - [ ] import sys
> - [ ] wc variables.py
> - [x] **echo $?**

*Great work! Echo will print out the exit value (question mark variable) of a script that just ran successfully.*

### Question 2

2\. Which  command will create a new environment variable?

> - [x] **export**
> - [ ] wc
> - [ ] input
> - [ ] env

*Right on! This command will create a new environment variable, and give it a value.*

### Question 3

3\. Which I/O stream are we using when we use the input function to accept user input in a Python script?

> - [ ] STDOUT
> - [ ] STDERR
> - [ ] **STDIN**
> - [ ] SYS

*Awesome! STDIN is the standard I/O stream for input.*

### Question 4

4\. What is the meaning of an exit code of 0?

> - [ ] The program ended with an unspecified error
> - [ ] The program ended with a ValueError.
> - [ ] The program ended with a TypeError.

*Nice job! An exit value of 0 always indicates the program exited without error.*

> - [x] **input performs basic math operations.**
> - [ ] raw_input performs basic math operations.
> - [x] **raw_input gets a string from the user.**
