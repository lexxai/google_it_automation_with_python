# Practice Quiz: Other Test Concepts

*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%.*

### Question 1

1. In what type of test is the code not transparent?

> - [ ] Test-driven development
> - [x] **Black-box test**
> - [ ] White-box test
> - [ ] Smoke test

*Nice work! This type of test relies on the tester having no knowledge of the code.*

### Question 2

2. Verifying an automation script works well with the overall system and external entities describes what type of test?

> - [x] **Integration test**
> - [ ] Load test
> - [ ] Smoke test
> - [ ] Regression test

*Great job! This test verifies that the different parts of the overall system interact as expected.*

### Question 3

3. _____ ensures that any success or failure of a unit test is caused by the behavior of the unit in question,\
 and doesn't result from some external factor.

> - [ ] Regression testing
> - [ ] Integration
> - [x] **Isolation**
> - [ ] White-box testing

*Right on! By ensuring the unit of code we are testing is isolated, we can ensure we know where the bug originated.*

### Question 4

4. A test that is written after a bug has been identified in order to ensure the bug doesn't show up again later is called _____

> - [ ] Load test
> - [ ] Black-box test
> - [ ] Smoke test
> - [x] **Regression test**

*Excellent! Regression testing is a type of software test used to confirm that a recent program or code*\
*change has not adversely affected existing features, by re-executing a full or partial selection test cases.*

### Question 5

5. What type of software testing is used to verify the softwareâ€™s ability to behave well under\
 significantly stressed testing conditions?

> - [x] **Load test**
> - [ ] Black-box test
> - [ ] Smoke test
> - [ ] Regression test

*Way to go! Load testing verifies the behavior of the software remains consistent under conditions of significant load.*
