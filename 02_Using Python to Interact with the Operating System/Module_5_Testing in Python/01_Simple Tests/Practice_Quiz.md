# Practice Quiz: Simple Tests

*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%.*

### Question 1

1. You can verify that software code behaves correctly using test ...

> - [ ] Functions
> - [x] **Cases**
> - [ ] Loops
> - [ ] Arguments

*Awesome! The software code should behave the way you expect with as many possible values or test cases.*

### Question 2

2. What is the most basic way of testing a script?

> - [ ] Codifying tests into the software.
> - [ ] Let a bug slip through.*
> - [x] **Different parameters with expected results**
> - [ ] Write code to do the tests.

*Right on! The most basic way of testing a script is to use different parameters and get the expected results.*

### Question 3

3. When a test is codified into its own software, what kind of test is it?

> - [ ] Unit test
> - [ ] Integration test
> - [x] **Automatic test**
> - [ ] Sanity testing

*Nice job!  Codifying tests into its own software and code that can be run to verify that our programs*\
*do what we expect them to do is automatic testing.*

### Question 4

4. Using ... simplifies the testing process, allowing us to verify the program's behavior repeatedly with many possible values?

> - [ ] integration tests
> - [x] **test cases**
> - [ ] test-driven development
> - [ ] interpreter

*Great work! Test cases automatically test with a range of possible values to verify the programâ€™s behavior.*

### Question 5

5. The more complex our code becomes, the more value the use of ... provides in managing errors.

> - [ ] loops
> - [ ] functions
> - [ ] parameters
> - [x] **software testing**

*Awesome! Software testing is the process of evaluating computer code to determine whether or not it does what you*\
*expect it to do, and the more complex the code, the more likely failure is.*
