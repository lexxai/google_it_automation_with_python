# Course Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the last course of this program!

Throughout this program, you've had the opportunity to learn and practice lots of different tools and techniques for\
creating and maintaining automation. You've learned how to write programs in Python, how to interact with files and\
processes from your Python scripts, how to track the history of your changes using Git, how to understand what's\
happening when the automation doesn't work as expected, and how to automate your infrastructure by using tools like\
Puppet. Phew, that’s a lot!

This last course will give you the opportunity to put all this new knowledge in action. You'll be given a bunch of\
small projects based on real-life scenarios, and you'll use Python to write the automation that will solve the challenges.

Working on these projects will give you the opportunity to start building your programming portfolio. When you’re done\
with each of them, you can upload the code you write to GitHub to show off your skills!

Since this course builds on top of everything taught in the other courses, you need to have working knowledge of the main\
concepts we covered: coding in Python, interacting with files and processes, using Git, using the Linux command line,\
troubleshooting problems, and working with Cloud infrastructure.

Throughout the course, we'll give you an introduction to the tools and techniques necessary for solving each of the projects.\
We recommend that you follow along by coding on your own computer. Coming up with your own exercises and practicing using\
the tools that you learn is the best way to master them.

One final note. As you probably noticed, this is a reading and not a video. :) This course is composed of readings that guide\
you along the path of using Python to solve real-life problems, along with labs that let you put that knowledge in action.\
We hope you enjoy the challenges and the new skills you gain along the way.
