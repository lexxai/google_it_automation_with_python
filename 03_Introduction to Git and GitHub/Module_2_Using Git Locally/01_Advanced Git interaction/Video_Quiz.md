# Video Quiz: Advanced Git interaction

### Question 1

2. If we're making a small change and want to skip the staging step,\
 which two flags do we need to add to the git commit command? Check all that apply.

> - [x] **-m**
> - [ ] -t
> - [ ] -l
> - [ ] -a

*Right on! The -m flag allows us to directly add the commit message to the command.*

### Question 2

2. If we want to see a specific commit, which command would we use along with the commit ID?

> - [ ] git log --stat
> - [x] **git show**
> - [ ] git log -p
> - [ ] git commit -am 

*You nailed it! Taking the commit ID, git show will show information about the commit and its associated patch.*

### Question 3

3. If we need to delete a file from our repository, we'll need to run a command to delete the file\
 and then stage and commit the change. Which command would we use to delete the file?

> - [x] **git rm**
> - [ ] git mv
> - [ ] git diff
> - [ ] git del

*Woohoo! This command removes files from the working tree and from the index.*
