# Practice Quiz: Code Reviews

*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%*

### Question 1

1. When should we respond to comments from collaborators and reviewers?

> - [ ] When their comments address software-breaking bugs
> - [ ] No need, just resolve the concerns and be done with it
> - [x] **Always**
> - [ ] Only when a code correction is necessary

*Excellent! It is good manners and proper conduct to respond, even when it's simply an acknowledgement.*

### Question 2

2. What is a nit?

> - [x] **A trivial comment or suggestion**
> - [ ] A couple lines of code
> - [ ] A repository that is no longer maintained
> - [ ] An orphaned branch

*Good work! In git jargon (and elsewhere in the tech world), a nit is a minor “nitpick” about a piece of code.*

### Question 3

3. Select common code issues that might be addressed in a code review. (Check all that apply)

> - [x] **Using unclear names**
> - [ ] Following PEP8 guidelines
> - [x] **Forgetting to handle a specific condition**
> - [x] **Forgetting to add tests**

*Excellent! Unclear names can make our code hard to understand.*\
*Alright! If there is a specific condition that could cause a problem and we don't address it,*\
*the result could be catastrophic.*\
*Woohoo! Tests are an important addition to our code to ensure it runs smoothly.*

### Question 4

4. If we've pushed a new version since we've made a recent change, what might our comment be flagged as?

> - [ ] Accepted
> - [ ] Resolved
> - [x] **Outdated**
> - [ ] Merged

*Nice job! If we push a new version after making a change, old comments are marked with the "Outdated" flag.*

### Question 5

5. What are the goals of code review? (Check all that apply)

> - [x] **Make sure that the contents are easy to understand**
> - [x] **Ensure consistent style**
> - [ ] Build perfect code
> - [x] **Ensure we don't forget any important cases**

*Right on! By reviewing our code, we can identify where we can make our code more clear and easy to understand.*\
*Awesome! By comparing our code to style guidelines, we can keep our style consistent and readable.*\
*Good job. Code review can reveal cases or conditions we need to handle in our code.*
